```{r load libraries and data}
library(sf)

lake_regions <- st_read("mapping_files")
```

Plot lakes by region to see if it looks how I expect: 
- It looks like this data set breaks the lake into a few more regions than I would. Still useful!
```{r preliminary visualization}
baseMap <- ggplot(lake_regions) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = GNIS_NAME)) 
baseMap

```
