This is a document dedicated to compiling data for my final project. The goal is to amass data from zebra and quagga mussel literature to input into fish bioenergetics 4 to make physiological models. 
Input data sets: 
Quagga mussel respiration: 
- Tyner, E. H., Bootsma, H. A., & Lafrancois, B. M. (2015). Dreissenid metabolism and ecosystem-scale effects as revealed by oxygen consumption. Journal of Great Lakes Research, 41, 27â€“37.


Output: 
(.csv file that will be compatible with fishbioenergetics 4.0)

```{r Load libraries}

library(dplyr)
```


```{r Read in data}

```

```{r Extract relevant values}

```

```{r Create new data frame}
